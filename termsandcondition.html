                  of the Participating Platforms, their business and user terms
                  and conditions apply along with these T&amp;Cs. The SSOID
                  shall be owned and operated by FG for use on all Participating
                  Platforms. For the use of FG’s SSOID service, the user must
                  register. Registration as a user is only allowed if the user
                  meets the eligibility criteria as set out in these T&amp;Cs.
                  Each user can set up only one user account. The user is
                  obliged to provide correct and complete information during the
                  registration and use of the SSOID service. The login data is
                  intended solely for personal use by the user and therefore
                  always to be kept secret and safe. The user is not entitled to
                  share his login details with third parties to use the SSOID
                  service or to disclose them otherwise. The user is obliged to
                  inform FG immediately on becoming aware of and/or suspecting a
                  case of any unauthorized use, disclosure and/or misuse of
                  their access data or of their user account. Furthermore, the
                  user is obliged not to use the user account of another person.
                  Submission of the duly completed registration form by the user
                  simply provides invitation to us to make an offer to enter
                  into the agreement on the use of our SSOID service
                  (hereinafter the SSOID Agreement). Our offer for the
                  conclusion of the SSOID Agreement is then effected by the fact
                  that FG sends the user a confirmation by e mail, in which a
                  confirmation link is included next to the user name and the
                  password for the SSOID Service. By the user clicking on this
                  confirmation link, the user accepts FG’s offer, so that in
                  this way the SSOID Agreement enters into force. Conclusion of
                  the SSOID Agreement may, also be effected through other
                  communication modes and following such processes which help
                  achieve the same purpose as the aforementioned e-mail
                  confirmation process. WPO11 is entitled to reject
                  individual users without giving reasons. The user guarantees
                  that the data submitted for their user account (and any other
                  information that is otherwise left for FG) are in all respects
                  complete, true, accurate and not misleading. Any changes to
                  user’s data should be promptly updated correctly in its
                  account.
